# Introduction to Machine Learning (and Tuning)
Simple Feed-Forward Neural Network that classifies characters on the mnist dataset.

Learn to:
 - Create Neural Networks in _Pytorch_
 - Visualize Training with _Tensorboard_ and _Weights and Bias_
 - Learn to setup hyperparameter control from the command-line for fast tuning
